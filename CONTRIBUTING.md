# Contributing to GopherTube

Hey there! Thanks for your interest in making GopherTube better. We’re a small project and every bit of help counts—whether it’s code, ideas, bug reports, or just encouragement.

## How to Get Involved

### Found a Bug?
- Check the [issues](https://github.com/KrishnaSSH/GopherTube/issues) to see if it’s already reported.
- If not, open a new issue. The more details you give (steps, logs, screenshots), the easier it is for us to help.

### Got an Idea?
- We love new ideas! Open an issue with the `enhancement` label and tell us what you’re thinking.
- Even if it’s just a rough thought, share it—we can figure it out together.

### Want to Code?
- Fork the repo and make a branch off `main`.
- Keep your changes focused and your commit messages short and clear.
- If you’re changing something users will see, update the docs too.
- Test your code before you send a pull request.
- format your code using the ```make fmt``` command 
- Link any related issues in your PR (like `Closes #123`).

### Code Style
- Use Go’s standard style (`gofmt` is your friend).
- Keep things simple and readable.
- Short, clear commit messages are best.

### Be Nice
- We’re all here to learn and build something cool. Please be friendly and respectful.
- Newcomers are welcome—don’t be shy!
- If you see something that’s not okay, let the maintainers know.
